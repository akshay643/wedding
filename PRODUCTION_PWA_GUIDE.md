# PWA Production Deployment Guide

## ✅ PWA Production Checklist

### 1. **HTTPS Requirement (Critical)**
- ✅ PWA **requires HTTPS** in production
- ✅ Service Workers only work over HTTPS
- ✅ Install prompts only appear on HTTPS sites

### 2. **Domain Configuration**
Your manifest and service worker are set up to work with any domain, but verify:
- ✅ `start_url: "/"` - works for any domain
- ✅ `scope: "/"` - covers entire site
- ✅ Service worker registered with `scope: "/"`

### 3. **Production Hosting Platforms**

#### **Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Service Worker support
- ✅ PWA-friendly headers
- ✅ Edge network for fast loading

#### **Netlify**
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist folder or connect GitHub
```
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ PWA support out of the box
- ✅ Custom headers configuration

#### **Other Platforms**
- **Heroku**: Requires HTTPS setup
- **AWS/GCP**: Need to configure HTTPS
- **Traditional servers**: Must have SSL certificate

### 4. **Build Configuration**
Current setup is production-ready:
- ✅ Service Worker enabled
- ✅ Manifest optimized
- ✅ Icons generated
- ✅ Caching configured

### 5. **Production Testing**
After deployment, test:
1. ✅ HTTPS loads correctly
2. ✅ Service Worker registers
3. ✅ Manifest loads at `/manifest.json`
4. ✅ Install prompt appears
5. ✅ App works offline

## 🚀 Quick Production Deploy

### Option 1: Vercel (Easiest)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Netlify
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `.next`
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Manual Deploy
```bash
npm run build
npm run export  # Creates static files
# Upload to any static hosting with HTTPS
```

## 🔧 Production Environment Variables

If using any environment variables, set them in production:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## 📱 Post-Deployment PWA Testing

1. **Chrome DevTools Audit**
   - Run Lighthouse PWA audit
   - Should score 90+ for PWA

2. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test install prompt on mobile
   - Verify offline functionality
   - Check app icon and splash screen

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Chrome/Edge: Full PWA support
   - Safari: Basic PWA support
   - Firefox: Good PWA support

## 🎯 Expected Production Results

After deployment to HTTPS domain:
- ✅ Install prompt appears automatically
- ✅ App can be installed on mobile/desktop
- ✅ Works offline with cached content
- ✅ Appears in app drawer when installed
- ✅ Standalone app experience

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Production Issues

### If install prompt doesn't appear:
1. Check HTTPS is working
2. Verify service worker in DevTools
3. Check manifest at `/manifest.json`
4. Use Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest
5. Check Lighthouse PWA score

### Common Production Issues:
- **No HTTPS**: PWA features disabled
- **Wrong headers**: Service worker fails
- **Missing manifest**: Install prompt blocked
- **Large app**: May need engagement first

Your current PWA setup is production-ready! The main requirement is deploying to an HTTPS domain.
