# üîß CI/CD Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Your GitHub Actions workflow wasn't updating production because:
1. ‚ùå The workflow was calling `./deploy.sh` but your script is named `deploy-production.sh`
2. ‚ùå The deployment script wasn't pulling latest code from GitHub
3. ‚ùå The script wasn't properly restarting the application after deployment

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
```yaml
- name: üöÄ Deploy to GCP VM
  run: |
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.VM_USER }}@${{ secrets.VM_HOST }} \
      "cd ${{ secrets.APP_DIR }} && ./deploy-production.sh"
```

### 2. Updated Deployment Script (`deploy-production.sh`)
Now the script:
- ‚úÖ **Pulls latest code** from GitHub (`git pull origin main`)
- ‚úÖ **Installs dependencies** (`npm install`)
- ‚úÖ **Applies nginx fixes** for large uploads (2GB limit)
- ‚úÖ **Builds the application** (`npm run build`)
- ‚úÖ **Restarts the app** (PM2 or manual restart)

### 3. Made Scripts Executable
- ‚úÖ `deploy-production.sh` is now executable
- ‚úÖ `fix-gcp-upload-limits.sh` is now executable

## Ready to Deploy

Now when you commit and push, the deployment will work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: CI/CD deployment and 413 upload errors"
git push origin main
```

## What Happens on Deployment

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** when you push to main
2. **SSH into your GCP VM** using your secrets
3. **Run deploy-production.sh** which will:
   - Pull latest code from GitHub
   - Install any new dependencies 
   - Apply nginx configuration for 2GB uploads
   - Build the application
   - Restart nginx and your Node.js app
4. **Upload limits increased to 2GB**

## Verification

After deployment, check:
- ‚úÖ Your website updates with latest changes
- ‚úÖ Large file uploads (up to 2GB) work
- ‚úÖ No more 413 errors for normal files
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for oversized files

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the fixes
2. **Watch GitHub Actions** tab for deployment progress
3. **Test large file uploads** after deployment completes
4. **Monitor logs** if any issues occur

The deployment should now work correctly and fix your 413 upload errors!
