# 🔧 CI/CD Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Your GitHub Actions workflow wasn't updating production because:
1. ❌ The workflow was calling `./deploy.sh` but your script is named `deploy-production.sh`
2. ❌ The deployment script wasn't pulling latest code from GitHub
3. ❌ The script wasn't properly restarting the application after deployment
4. ❌ PWA service worker was caching old build files causing 404 errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
```yaml
- name: 🚀 Deploy to GCP VM
  run: |
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.VM_USER }}@${{ secrets.VM_HOST }} \
      "cd ${{ secrets.APP_DIR }} && ./deploy-production.sh"
```

### 2. Updated Deployment Script (`deploy-production.sh`)
Now the script:
- ✅ **Pulls latest code** from GitHub (`git pull origin main`)
- ✅ **Installs dependencies** (`npm install`)
- ✅ **Clears PWA cache** (removes old service worker files)
- ✅ **Applies nginx fixes** for large uploads (2GB limit)
- ✅ **Builds the application** (`npm run build`)
- ✅ **Restarts the app** (PM2 or manual restart)

### 3. Fixed PWA Service Worker Issues (`next.config.js`)
- ✅ **Excluded build manifests** from service worker precaching
- ✅ **Added better caching strategies** for Next.js static files
- ✅ **Added PWA update handler** to manage cache updates

### 3. Made Scripts Executable
- ✅ `deploy-production.sh` is now executable
- ✅ `fix-gcp-upload-limits.sh` is now executable

### 4. Added PWA Update Management
- ✅ **PWAUpdateHandler component** for automatic cache updates
- ✅ **Service worker cleanup** on deployment
- ✅ **Better error handling** for missing build files

## Ready to Deploy

Now when you commit and push, the deployment will work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: CI/CD deployment and 413 upload errors"
git push origin main
```

## What Happens on Deployment

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** when you push to main
2. **SSH into your GCP VM** using your secrets
3. **Run deploy-production.sh** which will:
   - Pull latest code from GitHub
   - Install any new dependencies 
   - Apply nginx configuration for 2GB uploads
   - Build the application
   - Restart nginx and your Node.js app
4. **Upload limits increased to 2GB**

## Verification

After deployment, check:
- ✅ Your website updates with latest changes
- ✅ Large file uploads (up to 2GB) work
- ✅ No more 413 errors for normal files
- ✅ No more PWA service worker 404 errors
- ✅ PWA update notifications work properly
- ✅ Proper error messages for oversized files

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the fixes
2. **Watch GitHub Actions** tab for deployment progress
3. **Test large file uploads** after deployment completes
4. **Monitor logs** if any issues occur

The deployment should now work correctly and fix your 413 upload errors!
